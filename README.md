# nodejs-boilerplate

This is a very bare/raw nodejs boilerplate to get a nodejs project started quickly without dealing with all the hasle of setting up most of the stuff you want. 

### eslint
- Eslint has been very useful Period(.)
### airbnb style guide
- Most Airbnb's code style/guide are useful, I just turned off things that I do not like.
### babel
- This is kind of the defacto on JS world, it allows you to use ES features that are not yet available on nodejs.
### nodemon
- For any changes that occurs. This will reset your server automatically. Saves me few seconds of doing it manually.
